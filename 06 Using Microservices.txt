How we created Contact manager project? Spring boot 

	How? monolithic

	What done?
		login
		get user using id
		add contacts in backend
		check your contacts

Now we use microservices
Objective:

1) Create User service //microservice
	//how will we call? ip and port

2) Create contact service //microservice
	//how will we call?ip and port

3) Create API Gateway	 //also a microservice						//Single End point
	//handles multiple multiple microservice calls

4) Communicate User service with contact service


5) Register 3 microservices in Eureka Service Registry
		//Register in Eureka Server
		//to remove dependency in intercommunication 
		// 

Test:
Client sends request to API Gateway
according to what route client accessing

 if /user -> UserService
 if /contact -> ContactService
